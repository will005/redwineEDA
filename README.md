# EDA on a red wine data
This project focused on learning and using R to explore a dataset containing red wine chemical attributes and ratings given. The aim of the project was to explore and visualize the dataset using R's ggplot library. Some light data wrangling was done, however, the dataset was already in a nice and tidy state. A future consideration for returning to this dataset would be to run regression analysis to determing if quality ratings are associated with certain chemical features in wine. In addition, pairing with a white wine dataset to compare overall ratings would also be an interesting project. 

This project was a part of the Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree.
